# Problem Statement:
In a rapidly evolving digital media landscape, understanding and classifying news articles have become crucial. I tackled this challenge by leveraging NLP techniques to categorize news articles into predefined topics and extract valuable insights from the textual content.

# Key Components:

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset from inshorts.com by performing various text preprocessing steps:

1-Lowercasing: Standardized text to lowercase for uniformity.

2- URL Removal: Eliminated URLs to reduce noise in the dataset.

3- HTML Tags Removal: Stripped HTML tags for cleaner text.

4- Abbreviation Replacement: Replaced abbreviations to enhance readability.

5- Emoji Removal: Removed emojis for a more focused analysis.

6- Tokenization: Tokenized the text to break it down into meaningful units.

7- Stopword Removal: Eliminated common stopwords to focus on significant content.

8- Punctuation Removal: Removed unnecessary punctuation marks.

# Topic Classification:
Developed NLP classification models using Bag-of-Words (BOW) pipelined with a multinomial model. Explored various techniques, including logistic regression, random forests, and delved into deep learning architectures such as CNNs and transformers (BERT).

# Model Training and Evaluation:
Trained the models on a labeled dataset, fine-tuning for improved accuracy. Evaluated performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Topic Analysis and Insights:
Uncovered trends, popular topics, and patterns in news coverage, providing a deeper understanding of public discourse over time.

# Visualization and Reporting:
Created visually informative representations, including topic distribution plots, word clouds, and trend graphs, to present findings

# Outcomes:

Trained NLP models capable of accurate news categorization.
Insights into topic distribution and trends across different categories.
Recommendations for improving classification accuracy.

# Deliverables:

Preprocessed dataset with labeled categories.
Trained classification models with evaluation results.
Comprehensive report summarizing findings and insights.

# Conclusion:

This project aims to leverage natural language processing techniques to perform news classification and
analysis, providing valuable insights into the distribution of topics and trends in news coverage. By
automating the classification process and extracting actionable insights from news content, this project
contributes to enhancing information retrieval and understanding in the dynamic news landscape
